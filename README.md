## Description
For an employee working a shift from 9 - 5, I fixed and created a properly functioning Work Day Scheduler. To assist the employee in managing their time most effectively when they write events/meetings in this scheduler, I have added coded color time blocks to help differentiate between past, present and future. As time goes on in their work day, these color coded blocks will change depending on what hour they are currently on with gray representing past, red representing current and green representing future scheduled events.
