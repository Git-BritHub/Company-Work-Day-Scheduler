## Description
For an employee working a 9 to 5, I fixed and created a fully functioning Workday Scheduler. To assist employees in managing their time most effectively when they input events/meetings in this scheduler, I have added color-coded time blocks to help differentiate between past, present and future events. As time goes on in their work day, these color-coded blocks will change depending on what hour they are currently on with gray representing past, red representing current, and green representing future scheduled events.
